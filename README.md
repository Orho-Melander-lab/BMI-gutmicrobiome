# Body mass index as a determinant of gut microbiome composition and function: results of a comprehensive analysis of a large population 

# Study overview
In this project, we studied the connection between BMI and gut metagenome in 3 large Swedish population cohorts (n = 9,993): The Swedish CArdioPulmonary bioImage 
Study (SCAPIS Malmö and SCAPIS Uppsala) and Malmö Offspring Study (MOS).

## 1. Study abstract:
In this study, we examined the complex nature of the associations between body mass index (BMI) and the gut microbiome in 9,993 individuals from three Swedish cohorts with identical metagenomic analysis. Our comprehensive analytical workflow: (1) addressed challenges in microbiome data analysis, (2) modeled species data using three complementary approaches, and (3) assessed the potential effect of genetically predicted obesity on microbiome using two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR).
Of the 1,280 metagenomic species analysed, 1,228 (96%) were associated with BMI, and of these 276 (22%) were directionally consistent across the three models. We identified 753 (59%) species as less likely to be present among those with higher BMI. MR analyses provided evidence that genetically predicted obesity reduces gut microbial alpha-diversity, increases abundance of 39 species of oral origin, affects abundance of 55 species and eight microbial pathways including decreased butyrate production and mucin degradation, and increased propionate production. 
In conclusion, the observation that higher BMI is associated with a broad reduction in species prevalence, together with novel MR evidence suggesting that this association may be causal, support the view that BMI is one of the determinants of gut microbiome diversity, composition, and function. Our results provide a solid foundation for further research aimed at identifying and validating potential targets for interventions to modulate the gut-brain and the oral-gut-brain axes in obesity.
